        Hi! My name is Seda den Boer, I'm 21 years old and I'm living in the city of Harderwijk (famous for it's controversial Dolfinarium). This will be my fourth year of studying Bèta-Gamma with a physics major at the University of Amsterdam. This means that I spend most of my time racking my brain about some equations describing the biggest or the smallest phenomena in the universe. The Bèta-Gamma part means that I also spend a lot of time on being indecisive. Anyways, in my third year I decided that I did not hate programming as much as I did in my first year, when the share of frustration and lack of sleep where around 99% with 1% succesful debugging euphoria. I think now it's about 30% frustration, 10% lack of sleep, 59% enjoying challenging puzzles and 1% succesful debugging euphoria. This eventually led me here, building (read: freestyling) my first ever webpage.
