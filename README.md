# Seda's Internet Crib

My website is a personal 'allegaartje' of things I'm interested in. Since it's my first website ever, I didn't really know what information to fill up the pages with. I decided to fill them up with some random information, some art I made and some memes I like. The website was made for practicing with HTML, CSS and Git during the UvA programming minor course 'Programmeerplatform'.

## Contents
* There are two stylesheets; a CSS stylesheet and a SCSS stylesheet.
* index.html is a homepage
* aboutme.html is a short description of me, related to programming
* interests.html contains random information and I mainly used this page to practice with containers/grids/etc.
* art.html displays some drawings I made
* memes.html displays some memes
